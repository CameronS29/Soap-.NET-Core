# SoapCore
SOAP protocol middleware for ASP.NET Core.

Based on Microsoft article: [Custom ASP.NET Core Middleware Example](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/09/19/custom-asp-net-core-middleware-example/).

Support ref\out params, exceptions. Works with legacy SOAP\WCF-clients.

## Getting Started

### Installing
`PM> Install-Package SoapCore`

In Startup.cs:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
    app.UseSoapEndpoint<ServiceContractImpl>("ServicePath.asmx", new BasicHttpBinding());
}
